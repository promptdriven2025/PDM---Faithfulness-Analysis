These hybrids are given a smushed name of the two parents, such as Jug (for a Jack Russell Terrier and Pug cross) and the Beabull (Beagle mixed with a Bulldog).
Some people like to call designer dogs hybrids. This isn't factual. Hybrids are created when crossbreeding takes place between two species. Designer dogs are crossbreeds or mixed breeds born of registered doggy parents.
Despite the steep price tag, many dog lovers buy designer dog breeds. The reason for buying a hybrid designer dog is that hybrids are dogs that have the positive attributes of two separate dog breeds.

ROUND-02-194_194_0_A-8CAL0Q,"What is the difference between a mixed dog breed and a designer dog breed? Essencially, designer dogs are the offspring of the purposeful breeding of two different purebred dogs. This type of breeding has been done quite deliberately, so dog owners end up with the best of two very different dog breeds. These hybrids are given a smushed name of the two parents, such as Jug (for a Jack Russell Terrier and Pug cross) and the Beabull (Beagle mixed with a Bulldog).
Some people like to call designer dogs hybrids. This isn't factual. Hybrids are created when crossbreeding takes place between two species. Designer dogs are crossbreeds or mixed breeds born of registered doggy parents.
Despite the steep price tag, many dog lovers buy designer dog breeds. The reason for buying a hybrid designer dog is that hybrids are dogs that have the positive attributes of two separate dog breeds.

Intentional mixing of breeds optimizes the best characteristics of each parent. Sometimes the dog may have more than two pure breeds in his bloodline, but unlike a mutt, his lineage can be identified.
In the society of dogs, the class system has historically been divided into pure breeds and mixed breeds. The ""blue bloods"", or dogs of pedigree, were considered upper crust, while dogs of undocumented heritage (mixed breed, mutts, and mongrels) were considered common. However, the canine class system, much like human hierarchy, has been altered over time. Having a noble pure-bred birthright no longer always makes for a more desirable, prestigious, or expensive pet.

Dog crossbreeds, sometimes called designer dogs, are dogs which have been intentionally bred from two or more recognized dog breeds. They are not dogs with no purebred ancestors, but are not otherwise recognized as breeds in their own right, and do not necessarily breed true.

Notable canid hybrids include the coydog, coywolf, dingo–dog hybrid, jackal–dog hybrid, and wolfdog.",7,194,FILLA1,194_0_A,"{u'194': {u'position': 4.0, u'score': 0.5983089}}",66cc4d273042c44fb9fe96f4,4,designer dog breeds
